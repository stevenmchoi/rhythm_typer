# Rhythm Typer

## Overview

Rhythm Typer is simply a rhythm game with typing game elements, overlapping the goals of each.

In a traditional rhythm game, the beat map, when confined to a keyboard instead
of a touchscreen, tends to be limited to either the arrow keys or some of the
home row keys and spacebar. It normally makes sense to limit the number of keys
so that the player can focus more on keeping rhythm rather than trying to find the right keys to press.

With a typing game, however, when given a known word, a skilled typist can
quickly find the right keys without much forethought. By using recognized words,
Rhythm Typer makes the case that it can expand the range of possibilities in a
keyboard-based rhythm game by utilizing the skills of a touch typer.

Luckily, there doesn't seem to be an overlap
